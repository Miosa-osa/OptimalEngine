# Layer 3: Composition

> **Governing Constraint:** Ashby — Requisite Variety (genre repertoire)
> **Purpose:** The micro-structure within signals. Genre-specific skeletons. Granularity levels.
> **Position in onion:** Wraps L2 Signal. Wrapped by L4 Interface.
> **Existing code:** `miosa_signal.Classifier` (genre→structure mapping), `miosa_context` (SQLite skeleton store)

---

## What Composition Governs

L2 classifies a signal's five dimensions: `S = (M, G, T, F, W)`.

Composition governs **W** — the internal skeleton — for every genre in G.

A signal without a composition skeleton is unstructured information. Unstructured information is noise.
Composition is the layer that converts classified signals into decodable artifacts.

Three responsibilities:
1. **Genre templates** — required sections and field metadata for every genre
2. **Granularity levels** — L0 through L3, enabling progressive disclosure at retrieval
3. **Fact extraction** — decomposing signals into atomic SPO triples for the graph

---

## Genre Templates

Each genre defines a **W skeleton**: an ordered list of required and optional sections.

**Notation:**
- `[R]` = Required. Signal is invalid without it.
- `[O]` = Optional. Include when applicable.
- `[A]` = Auto-generated. System fills from context or metadata.

## Granularity Levels (L0–L3)

Every signal, regardless of genre, has four granularity levels. These enable progressive disclosure at L4 Interface. They are pre-computed at intake and stored in L5 Data.

| Level | Name | Target Length | Contents | When Used |
|-------|------|---------------|----------|-----------|
| **L0** | Headline | ~10 words | Subject + verb + object. No qualifiers. | Always-loaded context, dashboards, entity indexes |
| **L1** | Summary | ~50 words | Key facts. The 5 Ws where available. Links to L2. | L1 warm context tier, search result snippets |
| **L2** | Detail | ~500 words | Full genre skeleton with populated sections. Actionable. | Task-relevant context, agent working memory |
| **L3** | Complete | Unlimited | Everything. Verbatim source + all metadata. | Audit, deep research, archival retrieval |

**Examples for the same signal (sales brief, AI Masters):**

```
L0: Roberto directed Robert to activate AI Masters enterprise sales for Q1.

L1: Roberto Luna sent Robert Potter a sales brief on 2026-03-17 targeting AI
    Masters enterprise accounts. Objective: close 2 deals by end of Q1. CTA:
    schedule discovery calls this week. See L2 for full brief.

L2: [Full brief — Objective / Audience / Key Messages / CTA / Timeline]

L3: [L2 + original draft, revision history, related signals, decision trace,
    SPO triples, embedding vector, metadata]
```

**Generation rules:**
- L0 is always generated at intake. System-generated via template: `{subject} {verb} {object}`.
- L1 is generated at intake by the classifier. Max 3 sentences.
- L2 maps directly to the populated genre skeleton.
- L3 is the stored artifact itself — no generation, only retrieval.

---

## Fact Extraction

Every signal is decomposed into atomic Subject-Predicate-Object triples at intake. These populate the L5 knowledge graph and enable SPARQL traversal at retrieval.

**Format:** `(Subject, Predicate, Object)` where each element is a node or literal.

**Example input:**
> "Roberto decided to use OpenRouter for ClinicIQ on March 6"

**Extracted triples:**
```
(Roberto,      decided,          use_OpenRouter)
(ClinicIQ,     uses,             OpenRouter)
(decision,     date,             2026-03-06)
(decision,     decided_by,       Roberto)
(decision,     applies_to,       ClinicIQ)
```

**Extraction rules:**
1. One triple per atomic claim. Do not compress two claims into one triple.
2. Entities are normalized to canonical IDs (e.g., `Roberto` → `node:roberto_luna`).
3. Dates are ISO 8601 literals.
4. Predicates use snake_case. Prefer existing predicates before creating new ones.
5. If a claim is uncertain, add `(triple_id, confidence, 0.0–1.0)` meta-triple.
6. Decisions produce a `decision` node with `decided_by`, `decided_at`, `applies_to`, and `informed_by` predicates.

**Triple storage:** Written to `miosa_knowledge` SPARQL store. Indexed for FTS5. Linked to originating signal ID in SignalGraph.

---

## Composition by Mode

Signals have a mode dimension (M). Each mode has its own atomic units, molecular structures, and compound structures. Composition rules apply at each level of the hierarchy.

| Mode | Atoms | Molecules | Structures | Composition Rule |
|------|-------|-----------|------------|-----------------|
| **Linguistic** | Words, punctuation | Sentences, claims | Paragraphs, sections, documents | Genre skeleton governs ordering and completeness |
| **Visual** | Elements (icon, color, shape) | Components, frames | Layouts, dashboards, diagrams | Spatial hierarchy: Z-order, grouping, alignment |
| **Code** | Tokens, literals | Functions, modules | Packages, systems | Dependency direction: inward (no infrastructure in domain) |
| **Data** | Values, cells | Records, rows | Tables, schemas | Schema governs type, nullability, and relationships |

**Multi-mode signals** (e.g., a spec with both prose and code) must satisfy the composition rules for each mode independently, then integrate via a container structure (e.g., a document with embedded code blocks).

---

## Failure Modes at the Composition Layer

| Failure | Description | Detection | Remediation |
|---------|-------------|-----------|-------------|
| **Missing required section** | Genre skeleton has [R] field with no content | Classifier validation at intake | Request missing section or escalate to sender |
| **Wrong skeleton applied** | Signal classified as `brief` but structured as `report` | Section count mismatch vs expected skeleton | Re-classify or re-structure |
| **Granularity collapse** | L2 contains only L1-level content | Token count below threshold for L2 | Expand or demote to L1 |
| **Triple extraction failure** | Claims present but no SPO triples generated | Zero triples for non-chat signal | Re-run extractor; flag for manual review |
| **Skeleton drift** | Populated sections out of order | Section position vs template | Re-order; warn but do not reject |

---

## Relationship to Adjacent Layers

**From L2 (Signal):**
L2 provides the classified `G` (genre) dimension. Composition uses `G` to select the skeleton.
L2 also provides `M` (mode), which selects the appropriate mode composition rules.

**To L4 (Interface):**
Composition produces the four granularity levels (L0–L3) that L4 uses for tiered loading.
L4 selects which granularity to serve based on token budget and receiver type.
L4 never re-structures content — it selects pre-computed granularity artifacts produced here.

**To L5 (Data):**
Extracted SPO triples are written to the knowledge graph.
L0/L1/L2/L3 artifacts are stored in SignalGraph `context_tiers` table with the originating signal ID.
