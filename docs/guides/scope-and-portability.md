# Scope, sharing, and moving workspaces

## Engine scope

An Engine runs in one of two scopes.

| Scope | Set with | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `org` (default) | `OPTIMAL_ENGINE_SCOPE=org` | One Engine for an organization; every workspace is a walled section. A key scoped to one workspace never reads another. |
| `workspace` | `OPTIMAL_ENGINE_SCOPE=workspace` and `OPTIMAL_ENGINE_WORKSPACE=<id>` | Serves only that workspace; every other workspace is answered as not found. |

`GET /api/scope` reports the scope.
On disk, each workspace has its own directory: the default tenant keeps `<root>/<slug>`, and every other tenant gets `<root>/tenants/<tenant>/<slug>`, so two tenants' workspaces with the same slug never share files.

## Share-up policy

Each workspace has a share-up policy for org-wide views: `read` shares its results upward, `none` keeps them inside.
The default is `read`, except workspaces whose `visibility` is `private` or `client`, which default to `none`.
`PUT /api/workspaces/:id/share {"share_up": "read|none", "visibility": "private|client|internal"}` changes it (scope `topology:write`) and records the change in the authority evidence chain.
An org section set to `none` also keeps its policy from flowing down to the other workspaces (`chat-memory.md`).

## Federated search

`GET /api/federation/search?q=` searches every sharing workspace section the caller may see, plus registered peer workspace Engines that share upward.
Results carry `source_workspace_id` and `source_engine`; `sources` reports each section and peer, including peers that could not be reached.
Peers are registered with `POST /api/federation/peers {"workspace_id", "url", "api_key", "share_up"}` (admin); the key is encrypted with `CONNECTOR_KEY` and never returned.
Nothing is copied: a workspace Engine's data is only queried.

## Moving a workspace (split, merge, seed)

A bundle is a gzip tar file with `manifest.json`, one JSON-lines file per table, and the workspace's files.
It carries every row of every table with a `workspace_id` column, child rows without one, the principals the workspace's memberships name, and workspace-scoped operating documents.
Embeddings and other binary columns travel as base64, so vectors are copied, not recomputed; full-text indexes fill through the Engine's triggers as rows are inserted.
Authority state (keys, packs, grants, evidence), replica cursors, metric samples, redirects, and federation peers stay with the Engine.

| Step | Route (admin) |
| --- | --- |
| Export, optionally reserving a move | `POST /api/workspaces/:id/bundle {"for_move": true}` returns the bundle name and `bundle_sha256` |
| Download | `GET /api/bundles/:name` |
| Import on the target | `POST /api/bundles/import {"bundle": "<name>", "mode": "create|merge", "workspace_id"?, "organization_id"?}`, or the raw file with `content-type: application/gzip` |
| Finalize on the source | `POST /api/workspaces/:id/finalize-move {"bundle_sha256", "target_url", "target_workspace_id"}` |
| Resolve a citation | `GET /api/resolve?uri=optimal://<workspace>/...` returns `local` or `moved` with the new location |

Import verifies the manifest, every table file, and every file checksum before writing anything, then writes all rows in one transaction with foreign keys checked at commit.
Tenant and workspace ids are rewritten to the target; integer row ids are reassigned.
`create` refuses an existing workspace; `merge` keeps existing rows.
The source deletes nothing until `finalize-move` receives the same `bundle_sha256` the target reported, then removes the workspace's rows and files, archives the workspace, and records a redirect so `optimal://` citations keep resolving.

Split moves a workspace out of an org Engine; merge is the same steps in the other direction; seeding a new Engine is an import of a bundle.
